# where is it now?
This was a stepping stone for my current game project UnderGrowth it was never finished but I learned alot about how to the godot game engine and how I would rather structure my game logic and code. I am now applying what I learned In my current development of undergrowth.(https://github.com/TheLowSeas/Undergrowth2)
